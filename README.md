# Logistics Optimization System

## Introduction

The Logistics Optimization System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and enhance the efficiency of transportation logistics for businesses. This project aims to tackle the complex task of optimizing truck routes, fuel consumption, and truck type assignments to ensure cost-effectiveness and adherence to government regulations.

### Overview

In the realm of logistics, the efficient movement of goods is crucial for businesses to thrive. The Logistics Optimization System leverages mathematical modeling and optimization algorithms to determine the optimal routes, truck assignments, and fuel types, taking into account factors such as distance, fuel prices, and government restrictions.

### Motivation

This project was part of the first homework for an Optimization Course at UC3M. 
The motivation behind this project is to address the challenges faced by logistics departments in managing fleets of trucks. By automating the decision-making process, businesses can significantly reduce transportation costs, minimize fuel consumption, and ensure compliance with diesel restrictions imposed by regulatory bodies.

### Key Features

- **Route Optimization:** The system optimizes truck routes based on various parameters, such as distance, traffic conditions, and fuel efficiency.
- **Truck Assignment:** Assigns trucks to specific routes, considering factors like truck capacity and demand.
- **Fuel Type Optimization:** Determines the optimal fuel type (gas or diesel) for each route to minimize costs and comply with government regulations.


### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pyomo
- Pandas for Data Analysis
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
